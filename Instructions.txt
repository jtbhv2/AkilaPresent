The game runs on commands, and different things will happen depending on what you type.
There are some commands that can always be used, no matter what. These are things like
inventory, go, use, examine, etc. 

There are also some commands that can only be used in certain rooms.
These room specific commands will always be displayed after every line you type

The global ones will not be, but can still be used. HELP will list these out for you

Some commands can only be used after doing certain other actions
Example: The game may display "Commands: search, use."
Note that you could type one of these commands, OR and of the GLOBAL commands
After searching, you find a hidden switch.
Now, a hidden command called flip switch will appear in your list of commands and can now be called.

Some SUPER SECRET commands might never be displayed, but can still be used
These will be rare, and will never be required to finish the game


NOTE:
'go' will require a location to be typed after it. "go home"
but, it will only ever be displayed as 'go'

'use' and 'toss' work exactly the same way, but you can only use/toss items that you have in your inventory'
ie 'use ultimate scalpel'
