Okay this is going to be a choose your own adventure text based type thing.
What is the overall object of the game?
    Defeating an enemy?
        Only if it is not based on anything in real life
    Rescuing someone?
        Rescuing Brian from an enemy?
    Finding something?
        The Ultimate Doctor
        The Final Scalpel
    Why not all three? Find an object to defeat an enemy in order to rescue Brian!
        Akila must find the Final Scalpel and the Ultimate Scrub Top to defeat {something} in order to rescue Brian
What is the story?
Mild mannered Akila Blaze must go on a quest to find the sacred items in order to defeat the Evil General Anesthesia before she can suck the love
out of Brian's heart and become God King of the world
What will be the components?
    Choose your own adventure, for sure
    Will it be compiled?
        This would be ideal I think, leaves room for customization
    Will it be on a repeating three day cycle like in a time loop?
        That would be awesome, but maybe too much
    Multiple endings?
        Also yes. Buut how to implement this?
    Save System? 
        If akila fails or dies, how to revert?
