Overall, I want this story to involve a plot where Dr Blaze brother never died, but instead was shrunk down. 
He has been living inside of various people and animals, recruiting red blood cells to his cause
He does not know the suture wars have ended, and is plotting to use blood control to assassinate various generals, who have 
now either reformed or have risen to levels of power that could be dangerous

Akila Blaze - Protagonist
Wife Brian - Damsel in distress
Clotter Blaze/ The Hemogoblin - Antagonist and Dr Blaze's Brother
General Anesthesia - Antagonist from the first game who terrorizes akila's memories

suture Wars: Event long in the past that used SCP type medical monstrosities to do battle
    Alot of the suture wars will be explored so i need to figure that out

    gen an also opposing side
